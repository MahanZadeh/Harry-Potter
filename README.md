# Harry-Potter

A text-based RPG game set in Hogwarts with an engaging storyline. A python module that is playable in the terminal.

## Description

A small D&D-like game where the player can navigate a grid and encounter monsters, with an option to flee or fight.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Python 3.9

### Executing program

Run game.py

## Help

If you want to play the game more than once, you might want to remove some of the time.sleep() functions from game.py in order to skip the intial greeting messages faster.
